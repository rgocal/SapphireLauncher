# SapphireLauncher
Sapphire Launcher was a 3year long invested project as I have decided to open source in hopes the community will assist in future updates and features as I have moved onto a bigger and better launcher project.

Project still needs cleaned up from miscelanious crap I need to remove like dialogs for donating and google services stuff So i would recommend not using this code untill i do so. Using this repository to port into my next launcher project.
